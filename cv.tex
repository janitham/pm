	{Snooper}    
    {Packaging(Installation Distribution) Data Management Tool}
{This is a sub-project of package-automation(Stacker) project. An application stores the packaging information. Snooper provides and Restful-API and GUI to do the necessary operations.\\ \\Snooper architecture is based on micro-services-architecture. It is used micro-service architectures with Spring Cloud and Docker.(Spring-cloud, Spring-boot, Hibernate, Ms-Sql, AngularJs, Java, Docker)}
\\
\entry
    {}
	{Stacker}    
    {Packaging Automation Tool(Continuous Delivery, Team CI)}
    {Stacker is continuous delivery automation tool. This works on fully mavenized environment. Stacker can be used as an JAVA application or as a maven-plugin, it generates multi-module pom structure configured with different maven plugins(Two 			different frameworks are used in the product, packaging is done in different orders), using matadata(An artifact is released to nexus). Finally the package can be generated using the pom structure which is based on the baseline. \\ \\This stacker is recently using as a maven plugin which is configured in a Jenkins job, the job has also integrated with JIRA(using JIRA \& Jenkins plugins). Now, the package requester can create the package him self. \\ \\Stacker has also configured as a pipeline project in the Jenkis-job. Also a maven plugin is used to update package information management tool(Snooper) using it's Restful-APIs'.(Java, Maven-plugins, Jenkins, Jenkins-pipelines, Nexus, JIRA)}

    {Microphone Alternator of Android}
    {Computer Engineering Project}
    {This system mainly has clients and main server application. The client requests to connect with the server application using multi-casting. Subsequently, the client gets the access token to connect to server then the particular client can start uni-casting the sound stream (thorough Android smart-phones). The server application plays the sound stream. (Android, Java, UDP Socket Programming, multi-casting, uni-casting)}
