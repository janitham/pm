	{Snooper}    
    {Packaging Data Management Tool}
{This is a sub-project of package-automation(Stacker) project. An application was needed to store the packaging information. Snooper provides and Restful-API and graphical user interface to do the necessary operations.This snooper architecture is based on micro-services-architecture. It is used micro-service architectures with Spring Cloud and Docker.(Spring-cloud, Spring-boot, Hibernate, Ms-Sql, AngularJs, Java, Docker)}
\\

	{Stacker}    
    {Packaging Automation Tool(Continuous Delivery, Team CI)}
    {Stacker is continuous delivery automation tool. This works on fully mavenized environment. Stacker can be used as an JAVA application or as a maven-plugin, it generates multi-module pom structure configured with different maven plugins(Two 			different frameworks are used in the product, packaging is done in different orders), using matadata(An artifact is released to nexus). Finally the package can be generated using the pom structure. This stacker is recently using as a maven plugin which is configured in a Jenkins job, the job has also integrated with JIRA(using JIRA \& Jenkins plugins). Now, the package requester 		can create the package him self. This has also configured as a pipeline project in the Jenkis-job. Also a different phase is used in the pipeline with maven plugin to update package information management tool(Snooper) using its Restful-APIs'.(Java, Maven-plugins,Jenkins, Jenkins-pipelines, Nexus, JIRA)}
