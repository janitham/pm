    {Oct. 16 - Now}
    {Package Automation tool(Continuous delivery)}
    {Stacker}
    {Stacker is continuous delivery automation tool. This works on fully mavenized environment. Stacker can be used as an JAVA 		application or as a maven plugin, it generates multi-module pom structure configured with different maven plugins(Two 			different frameworks are used in the product, those packaging in different orders, uses different plugins) using matadata(An artifact is released to nexus). Finally the package can be generated using the pom structure. This stacker is recently using as a maven plugin which is configured in a jenkins job, the job has also integrated with JIRA. Now the package requester 		can create the package him self. This has configured as a pipeline project in Jenkis job. Also a different phase is used in the pipeline with maven plugin to update package information management tool(Snooper) with its api.(Java, Maven-plugins,Jenkins, Jenkins-pipelines, Nexus, JIRA)}
    \entry
    {Aug. 15 - Oct. 15}
    {Packaging data management tool}
    {Snooper}
{This is a sub-project of package-automation(Stacker) project. An application was needed to store the packaging information. Snooper provides and restful-api and graphical user interface to do necessary operations.This snooper architecture is based on micro-services-architecture. It is used micro-service architectures with Spring Cloud and Docker.(Spring-cloud,Spring, hibernate, ms-sql, AngularJs, Java)}
